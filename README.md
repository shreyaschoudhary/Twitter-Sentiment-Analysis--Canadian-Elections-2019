# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis--Canadian-Elections-2019
Sentiment Analysis is a branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that allows us to determine algorithmically whether a statement or document is “positive” or “negative”. Sentiment analysis is a technology of increasing importance in the modern society as it allows individuals and organizations to detect trends in public opinion by analyzing social media content. Keeping abreast of socio-political developments is especially important during periods of policy shifts such as election years, when both electoral candidates and companies can benefit from sentiment analysis by making appropriate changes to their campaigning and business strategies respectively.
